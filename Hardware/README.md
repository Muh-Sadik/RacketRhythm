To detect the impact of the ping pong ball on the racket several sensors were considered including force sensitive resistors, piezoelectric sensors and microphones. Microphones were chosen due to the fact that the sound of a ping pong ball making contact with a racket is distinguishable. A digital output would also be needed as the signal from the microphone will be transferred to the raspberry pi via a wire.
The Adrafruit I2S MEMs Microphone breakout board was purchased as the sensor choice.
