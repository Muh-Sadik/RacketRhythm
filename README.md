# Hardware Setup
Adrafruit I2S MEMs Microphone breakout board-SPH0645 was used in this setup. 
Microphone breakout board documentation can be found [here](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/adafruit-i2s-mems-microphone-breakout.pdf). GPIO pins connection are as follows:

```
Mic - RPi
---------
VCC - 3.3v
Gnd â€“ Gnd
BCLK  - BCM 18 (pin 12)
DOUT  - BCM 20 (pin 38)
LRCL  - BCM 19 (pin 35)
```

# Software Setup
**I2S Configuration:**  
To enable I2S on Raspberry Pi some modifications are needed:

* Uncomment ```#dtparam=i2s=on``` in ``` sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt ```
* Add ``` dtoverlay=i2s-mmap  ``` and ``` dtoverlay=googlevoicehat-soundcard  ``` This sets up the I2S mapping and activates the I2S sound card overlay.
* Add ``` snd-bcm2835   ``` to ``` sudo nano /etc/modules ```

**Kernel Compiling:**

* Update and install necessary dependencies:
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo rpi-update

# Check your Raspbian version:
$ gcc --version
gcc (Raspbian 12.2.0-14+rpi1) 12.2.0

# Mic dependencies that needed to be installed:
  $ sudo apt-get install bc
  $ sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev
  ```

**ALSA Configuration:**
  
Install Alsa library
```
$ sudo apt install libasound2-dev
$ sudo apt-get install alsa-utils sox
 ```
**Test the Microphone:**
 
* For mono system, use ```arecord -c 1 -r 48000 -f S32_LE -t wav -v filename.wav ``` or ``` Mono: arecord -f S32_LE -r 8000 -c 1 shaker2.wav  ```
* To play the file, use ``` Aplay filename.wav  ```
